# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?
    -If we will have access to official assets from their org.
2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.
    -As a user, I can browse an interactive map with incident markers.
3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story? 
    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
            -Same story, this requires learning to use mapbox. Building out full mapbox functionality will presumably be a challenge.
4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?
    -Be more specific in stories.
